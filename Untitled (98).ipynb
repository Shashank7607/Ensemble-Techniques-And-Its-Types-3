    "Random Feature Subsampling:\n",
    "\n",
    "During the construction of each decision tree, a random subset of features is considered at each split. This introduces additional randomness and diversity among the trees, contributing to the model's robustness.\n",

    "How it Works:\n",
    "Construction of Trees:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple decision trees are constructed, each using a different bootstrap sample of the data and considering a random subset of features at each split.\n",

    "Ensemble of Decision Trees:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Random Forest Regressor is built by combining predictions from multiple decision trees. Each decision tree is trained on a different subset of the data due to the use of bootstrap sampling. The ensemble nature helps reduce the impact of individual trees that might overfit to noise or outliers in the dataset.\n",
    "Bootstrap Sampling:\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm uses bootstrap sampling to create multiple training datasets by randomly drawing samples with replacement from the original dataset. As a result, each decision tree is exposed to a slightly different subset of the data, introducing diversity among the trees.\n",
    "Random Feature Subsampling:\n",
    "\n",
    "At each split during the construction of a decision tree, only a random subset of features is considered. This prevents individual trees from becoming overly specialized in certain features, reducing the risk of fitting noise.\n",
    "Averaging Predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "The final prediction of the Random Forest Regressor is obtained by averaging the predictions of all individual decision trees. This averaging process smoothens out the predictions and reduces the impact of outliers or extreme values predicted by individual trees.\n",
    "Regularization through Tree Depth:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each decision tree in the ensemble is typically grown only up to a certain depth. Limiting the depth of the trees acts as a form of regularization, preventing them from becoming too complex and capturing noise in the training data.\n",
    "Majority Voting Mechanism:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of regression, the final prediction is obtained through averaging the predictions of all trees. This averaging process helps create a more stable and generalizable model by mitigating the influence of individual trees' idiosyncrasies.\n",
    "Hyperparameter Tuning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forests have hyperparameters that can be tuned to control the behavior of the ensemble, such as the number of trees, maximum tree depth, and the number of features considered at each split. Proper hyperparameter tuning allows practitioners to strike a balance between model complexity and generalization.\n",
    "Out-of-Bag Error Estimation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forests use out-of-bag samples (data not included in the bootstrap sample used to train a specific tree) to estimate the model's performance. This provides a more reliable estimate of generalization error, helping to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "By combining these strategies, Random Forest Regressors create a robust ensemble that is less prone to overfitting compared to individual decision trees. The diversity among trees, introduced through bootstrap sampling and random feature subsampling, contributes to a more generalized model that can effectively capture underlying patterns in the data while avoiding fitting noise and outliers.\n",
